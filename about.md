<h2>whoami</h2>

I am a hacking enthusiast willing to learn and share stuff i like. I currently don't have any professional experience with programming/cybersecurity, but i like to practice my skills on my spare time. I have 15 years of experience using computers, ~8-9 years since my first contact with hacking, and ~4 years focusing on learning general pentesting & hacking stuff.
